    `Install-Module PScribo`

- Manually by downloading the [GitHub package](https://github.com/iainbrighton/PScribo)
  - Download and unblock the latest .zip file.
  - Extract the .zip into your $PSModulePath, e.g. ~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules.
    Ensure the extracted folder is named 'PScribo'.

    `Import-Module PScribo`

### Known Issues
- Table Of Contents (TOC) may be missing in Word formatted report

    When opening the DOC report, MS Word prompts the following 
    
    `"This document contains fields that may refer to other files. Do you want to update the fields in this document?"`
    
    `Yes / No`

    Clicking `No` will prevent the TOC fields being updated and leaving the TOC empty.

    Always reply `Yes` to this message when prompted by MS Word.

- In HTML documents, word-wrap of table cell contents is not working, causing the following issues;
  - Cell contents may overflow table columns
  - Tables may overflow page margin
  - [PScribo Issue #83](https://github.com/iainbrighton/PScribo/issues/83)

- In Word documents, some tables are not sized proportionately. To prevent cell overflow issues in HTML documents, most tables are auto-sized, this causes some tables to be out of proportion.
